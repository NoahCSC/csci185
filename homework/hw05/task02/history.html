                <h2>Native Peoples</h2>
        
                <p>When Europeans arrived, the area was inhabited by the Tonkawa tribe. Comanches and Lipan Apaches also traveled in the region. Though they came into contact with Spanish explorers and missions, few settlements were established for several centuries.</p>

                    <h2>Geographic Distinction</h2>
        
                    <p>Austin is situated at the foot of the Balcones Escarpment, a long stable and inactive fault line, on the Colorado River. This fault divides the Hill Country to the West of Austin from the prairie land to the East.</p>
