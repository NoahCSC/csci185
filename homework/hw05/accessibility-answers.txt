1. Do you think your website is usable if you turn off the CSS? Yes. Why or why not?

Your answers here. Yes, because all the info is still labeled by class and usable.

1. Is your site is tabbable? In other words, without the use of the mouse, are all the links and buttons accessible using the tab key?

Your answers here. Yes, except for the form because I don't know how to set up form labels properly.



Reminder: don't forget to include a screenshot of your Wave report and link to it from your homepage!
